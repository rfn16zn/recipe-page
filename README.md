## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing special so far. Except that editing tables is quite time-consuming.

### Continued development

I am still not confident enough with Flexbox and Grid, so I will focus more on them in future projects.

### Useful resources

[CSS Tricks - List Item Marker](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gap-after-the-list-marker/) - This page was very helpful since I have not found a way to adjust the margins/paddings or gap between the bullet points and list item content.
